# brain-dump

## Available Actions

### Check status
Run: `brain-dump status --json`
Returns: last backup time, repo health, total snapshots, stored size.

### Take a snapshot now
Run: `brain-dump snapshot --json`
Returns: snapshot ID, files new/changed, bytes added.
Only run when user asks. Scheduled backups handle this automatically.

### List snapshots
Run: `brain-dump list --latest 5 --json`
Returns: array of recent snapshots with IDs, timestamps, sizes.

### Restore (REQUIRES USER CONFIRMATION)
1. Show available snapshots: `brain-dump list --latest 10`
2. Ask user which snapshot to restore
3. ALWAYS restore to a temp directory: `brain-dump restore <ID> --target ~/brain-dump-restore`
4. Tell user where files are. Let THEM decide what to copy back.
5. NEVER run restore without user confirmation.
6. NEVER overwrite live agent directories automatically.

## When NOT to use this skill
- Don't run snapshot during time-sensitive operations
- Don't restore without explicit user request
- Don't modify the config file
- Don't change the schedule
